☐ Maybe need to find another name as application_id can't be a number?

        ✔ Prompt to choose a library location (folder) @done(19-06-21 21:58)
        ☐ Loading indicator on first parse

Bugs:
    ☐ On initial load the UI freezes for a small period of time, easily scene with the loading indicator
        I am not sure what is causing this... I have written debug statements everywhere but 
        they all run quickly and then the freeze comes. It's like the GTK is freezing trying to
        load..
