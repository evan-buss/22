☐ Maybe need to find another name as application_id can't be a number?

Design:
    ☐ Headerbar should have a button that toggles between different views
        ☐ Library View
            ☐ Grid View
            ☐ List View
            ☐ Sort / Order Library
            ☐ Search Library
            ☐ (maybe) bulk actions w/ multiselect
        ☐ Device management view
    ☐ Library should be searchable
    ☐ Non-icon view that groups books by author

Next Steps:
    ☐ Book card component
        ☐ Show current versions in the library
        ☐ Right click to show popover
            ☐ Delete Book
            ☐ Convert Book
            ☐ Edit Book Metadata
    ☐ Add books to library
        ☐ Robust metadata.opf parser
        ☐ Internet image scraper
        ☐ (maybe) Internet metadata parser
    ☐ First login landing page
        ☐ Prompt to download conversion binary (Amazon)
        ☐ Prompt to choose a library location (folder)
        ☐ Loading indicator on first parse
