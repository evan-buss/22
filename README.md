## Why?

Calibre is overkill for the majority of my ebook management needs. All I really need is a way to edit the book's metadata, convert the book to kindle format if necessary, and manage books that are installed on my devices. I don't need any sort of "server" or ebook viewing / editing capabilities. Calibre has grown into a behemoth of an an application; the goal of 22 is to provide similar features with a much lighter application.

## Goals

The library will follow the same folder and file structure as Calibre so you should
be able to use either application interchangably and with your existing Calibre library.

### Proposed Features
- [ ] View your ebook library
- [ ] Manage ebook metadata
- [ ] Convert epub to mobi (Support kindles)
  - Need to find a conversion library or write my own...
- [ ] Send books to e-readers
